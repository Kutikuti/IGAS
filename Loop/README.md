Loop
====

Lua object-oriented program system, also with a special syntax keyword system. Now, it only works for Lua 5.1. Since the 'getfenv', 'setfenv', 'newproxy' api is removed from Lua 5.2, the system won't works on it now.



How to use
====

Use loadfile or require to load the class.lua file in the folder. Then you can try the below code:

	do
		-- Define a class
		class "MyClass"
			function Greet(self, name)
				print("Hello " .. name .. ", My name is " .. self.Name)
			end

			property "Name" {
				Storage = "_Name",     -- The real field that used to store the value, explain later
				Type = System.String,  -- the property's type used to validate the value,
									   -- System.Sting means the value should be a string, also explain later.
			}
		endclass "MyClass"
	end

Now we create a class with a *Greet* method and a *Name* property. Then we can use it like :

	do
		-- Create the class's object, also with init settings, the init table can contains properties settings
		-- and many more settings in it, will be explained later.
		ob = MyClass{ Name = "Kurapica" }

		-- Call the object's method, Output : Hello Ann, My name is Kurapica
		ob:Greet("Ann")

		-- Property settings, 123 is not a string, Error : stdin:10: Name must be a string, got number.
		ob.Name = 123
	end

Here I use *do ... end* because you may try those code in an interactive programming environment, many definitions like class, struct, interface's definitions should be kept in one piece. After here, I'll not use *do ... end* again, but just remember to add it yourself.



Features
====

There are some keywords that released into the _G :

* namespace
* import
* enum
* struct
* class
* partclass
* interface
* partinterface
* Module

The *namespace* & *import* are used to control the namespace system used to store classes, interfaces, structs and enums.

The *enum* is used to define an enum type.

The *struct* is used to start the definition of a struct type. A data of a struct type, is a normal table in lua, without metatable settings or basic lua type data like string, number, thread, function, userdata, boolean. The struct types are used to validate or create the values that follow the explicitly structure that defined in the struct types.

The *class* & *partclass* are used to start the definition of a class. In an object-oriented system, the core part is the objects. One object should have methods that used to tell it do some jobs, also would have properties to store the data used to mark the object's state. A class is an abstract of objects, and can be used to create objects with the same properties and methods settings.

The *interface* & *partinterface* are used to start the definition of an interface. Sometimes we may not know the true objects that our program will manipulate, or we want to manipulate objects from different classes, we only want to make sure the objects will have some features that our program needs, like we may need every objects have a *Name* property to used to show all objects's name. So, the interface is bring in to provide such features. Define an interface is the same like define a class, but no objects can be created from an interface.

The *Module* is used to start a standalone environment with version check, and make the development with the lua-oop system more easily, like we don't need to write down full path of namespaces. This topic will be discussed at last.



namespace & import
====

In an oop project, there would be hundred or thousand classes or other data types to work together, it's important to manage them in groups. The namespace system is bring in to store the classes and other features.

In the namespace system, we can access those features like classes, interfaces, structs with a path string.

A full path looks like *System.Forms.EditBox*, a combination of words separated by '.', in the example, *System*, *System.Forms* and *System.Forms.EditBox* are all namespaces, the namespace can be a pure namespace used only to contains other namespaces, but also can be classes, interfaces, structs or enums, only eums can't contains other namespaces.


The *import* function is used to save the target namespace into current environment, the 1st paramter is a string that contains the full path of the target namespace, so we can share the classes and other features in many lua environments, the 2nd paramter is a boolean, if true, then all the sub-namespace of the target will be saved to the current environment too.

    import (name[, all])


If you already load the class.lua, you can try some example :

	import "System"  -- Short for import( "System" ), just want make it looks like a keyword

	print( System )          -- Output : System
	print( System.Object )   -- Output : System.Object
	print( Object )          -- Output : nil

	import ( "System", true )

	print( Object )          -- Output : System.Object

The System is a root namespace defined in the class.lua file, some basic features are defined in the namespace, such like *System.Object*, used as the super class of other classes.

Also you can see, *Object* is a sub-namespace in *System*, we can access it just like a field in the *System*.

---

The *namespace* function is used to declare a default namespace for the current environment, so any classes, interfaces, structs and enums that defined after it, will be stored in the namespace as sub-namespaces.

	namespace ( name )

Here a simple example :

	namespace "MySpace.Example"  -- Decalre a new namespace for the current environment

	class "NewClass"             -- The class also be stored in current environment when defined.
	endclass "NewClass"

	print( NewClass )            -- Output : MySpace.Example.NewClass

The namespace system is used to share features like class, if you don't declare a namespace for the environment, those features that defined later will be private.



enum
====

enum is used to defined new value types with enumerated values.

First, an example used to show how to create a new enum type :

	import "System"

	-- Define a enum data type
	enum "Week" {
		SUNDAY = 0,
		MONDAY = 1,
		TUESDAY = 2,
		WEDNESDAY = 3,
	    THURSDAY = 4,
	    FRIDAY = 5,
	    SATURDAY = 6,
	    "None",
	}

	-- All output : 0
	-- Acees the values as table field, just case ignored
	print( Week.sunday )
	print( Week.Sunday )
	print( Week.sundDay )

	-- Output : 'None'
	print( Week.none )

	-- Output : 'WEDNESDAY'
	print( System.Reflector.ParseEnum( Week, 3 ) )

The true format of the 'enum' function is

	enum( name )( table )

The *name* is a common string word, *enum(name)* should return a function to receive a table as the definition of the enum data type.

In the *table*, for each key-value pairs, if the key is *string*, the key would be used as the value's name, if the key is a number and the value is a string, the value should be used as the value's name, so the 'None' is the value's name in the enum *Week*.

In the last line of the example, *System.Reflecotr* is an interface used to provide some internal informations of the system. Here, *ParseEnum* is used to get the key of a enum's value.

---

Sometimes, we may need use the enum values as a combination, like Week.SUNDAY + Week.SATURDAY as the weekend days. We could use the System.__Flags__ attribute to mark the enum data type as bit flags data type (Attributes are special classes, only one for enums, the detail of the Attribute system will be explained later).

Here is the full example :

	import "System"

	System.__Flags__()
	enum "Week" {
		SUNDAY = 1,
		MONDAY = 2,
		TUESDAY = 4,
		WEDNESDAY = 8,
	    THURSDAY = 16,
	    FRIDAY = 32,
	    SATURDAY = 64,
	    "None",
	}

	-- Output : 65
	print( Week.SUNDAY + Week.SATURDAY )

	-- Output : SATURDAY	SUNDAY
	print( System.Reflector.ParseEnum( Week, 65 ) )

	-- Output : true
	print( System.Reflector.ValidateFlags( Week.SATURDAY, 65 ) )

	-- Output : false
	print( System.Reflector.ValidateFlags( Week.TUESDAY, 65 ) )

	-- Ouput : 128
	print( Week.None )


First, the enum values should be 2^n, and the system would provide auto values if no value is set, so the Week.None is 128.

The *ParseEnum* function can return multi-values of the combination, and *ValidateFlags* can be used to validate the values.



struct
====

The main purpose of the struct system is used to validate values, for lua, the values can be boolean, number, string, function, userdata, thread and table.

And in the *System* namespace, all basic data type have a struct :

* System.Boolean - The value should be mapped to true or false, no validation
* System.String  - means the value should match : type(value) == "string"
* System.Number  - means the value should match : type(value) == "number"
* System.Function  - means the value should match : type(value) == "function"
* System.Userdata  - means the value should match : type(value) == "userdata"
* System.Thread  - means the value should match : type(value) == "thread"
* System.Table  - means the value should match : type(value) == "table"

Those are the *basic* struct types, take the *System.Number* as an example to show the basic using :

	import "System"

	-- Output : 123
	print( System.Number( 123 ) )

	-- Error : [Number] must be a number, got string.
	print( System.Number( '123' ))

All structs can used to validate values. ( Normally, you won't need to write the 'validation' code yourselves.)

When the value is a table, and we may expect the table contains fields with the expected type values, and the *System.Table* can only be used to check whether the value is a table.

Take a position table as the example, we may expect the table has two fields : *x* - the horizontal position, *y* - the vertical position, and the fields' values should all be numbers. So, we can declare a *member* struct type like :

	import "System"

	struct "Position"
		x = System.Number
		y = System.Number
	endstruct "Position"

Here, *struct* keyword is used to begin the declaration, and *endstruct* keyword is used to end the declaration. Anything defined between them will be definition of the struct.

The expression *x = System.Number*, the left part *x* is the member name, the right part *System.Number* is the member's type, the type can be any classes, interfaces, enums or structs :

* For a given class, the value should be objects that created from the class.
* For a given interface, the value should be objects whose class extend from the interface.
* For a given enum, the value should be the enum value or the value's name.
* For a given struct, the value that can pass the validation of the struct.

So, we can test the custom struct now :

	-- Short for Position( {x = 123, y = 456} )
	pos = Position {x = 123, y = 456}

	-- Output : 123	-	456
	print(pos.x, '-', pos.y)

	-- Error : Usage : Position(x, y) - y must be a number, got nil.
	pos = Position {x = 111}

	-- Use the struct type as a table constructor
	pos = Position(110, 200)

	-- Output : 110	-	200
	print(pos.x, '-', pos.y)

---

In the previous example, the *x* and *y* field can't be nil, we can re-define it to make the field accpet nil value :

	struct "Position"
		x = System.Number + nil
		y = System.Number + nil
	endstruct "Position"

	-- No error now
	pos = Position {x = 111}

Normally, the type part can be a combination of lots types seperated by '+', *nil* used to mark the value can be nil, so *System.Number + System.String + nil* means the value can be number or string or nil.

---

If we want default values for the fields, we can add a *Validate* method in the definition, this is a special method used to do custom validations, so we can do some changes in the method, and just remeber to return the value in the *Validate* method.

	struct "Position"
		x = System.Number + nil
		y = System.Number + nil

		function Validate(value)
			value.x = value.x or 0
			value.y = value.y or 0

			return value
		end
	endstruct "Position"

	pos = Position {x = 111}

	-- Output : 111	-	0
	print(pos.x, '-', pos.y)

---

Or you can use a method with the name of the struct, the method should be treated as the constructor :

	struct "Position"
		x = System.Number + nil
		y = System.Number + nil

		-- The constructor should create table itself
		function Position(x, y)
			return { x = x or 0, y = y or 0 }
		end
	endstruct "Position"

	-- Validate won't go through the constructor
	pos = Position {x = 111}

	-- Output : 111	-	nil
	print(pos.x, '-', pos.y)

	pos = Position (111)

	-- Output : 111	-	0
	print(pos.x, '-', pos.y)

	-- The constructor should do the validate itself
	pos = Position ('X', 'Y')

	-- Output : X	-	Y
	print(pos.x, '-', pos.y)

There are many disadvantages in using the constructor, so, just leave the table creation to the struct system.

---

In sometimes, we need validate the values and fire new errors, those operations also can be done in the *Validate* method. Take a struct with two members : *min*, *max*, the *min* value can't be greater than the *max* value, so we should write :

	struct "MinMax"
		min = System.Number
		max = System.Number

		function Validate(value)
			assert(value.min <= value.max, "%s.min can't be greater than %s.max.")

			return value
		end
	endstruct "MinMax"

	-- Error : Usage : MinMax(min, max) - min can't be greater than max.
	minmax = MinMax(200, 100)

In the error message, there are two "%s" used to represent the value, and will be replaced by the validation system considered by where it's using. Here an example to show :

	struct "Value"
		value = System.Number
		minmax = MinMax
	endstruct "Value"

	-- Error : Usage : Value(value, minmax) - minmax.min can't be greater than minmax.max.
	v = Value(100, {min = 200, max = 100})

So, you can quickly find where the error happened.

---

We also may want to validate numeric index table of a same type values, like a table contains only string values :

	a = {"Hello", "This", "is", "a", "index", "table"}

We can declare a *array* struct for those types (A special attribtue for the struct):

	import "System"

	System.__StructType__( System.StructType.Array )
	struct "StringTable"
		element = System.String
	endstruct "StringTable"

	-- Error : Usage : StringTable(...) - [3] must be a string, got number.
	a = StringTable{"Hello", "World", 3}

It's looks like the *member* struct, but the member name *element* has no means, it's just used to decalre the element's type, you can use *element*, *ele* or anything else.

---

The last part about the struct is the struct methods. Any functions that defined in the struct definition, if the name is not the *Validate* and the struct's name, will be treated as the struct methods, and those methods will be copyed to the values when created.

	struct "Position"
		x = System.Number
		y = System.Number

		function Print(self)
			print(self.x .. " - " .. self.y)
		end
	endstruct "Position"

	pos = Position { x = 123, y = 456 }

	-- Output : 123 - 456
	pos:Print()

	pos = Position (1, 2)

	-- Output : 1 - 2
	pos:Print()

Only using the struct to validate a value or create a value, will fill the methods into the value.

Normally, creating a class is better than using the struct methods, unless you want do some optimizations.



class
====

The core part of an object-oriented system is object. Objects have data fields (property that describe the object) and associated procedures known as method. Objects, which are instances of classes, are used to interact with one another to design applications and computer programs.

Class is the abstract from a group of similar objects. It contains methods, properties (etc.) definitions so objects no need to declare itself, and also contains initialize function to init the object before using them.


Declare a new class
----

Let's use an example to show how to create a new class :

	class "Person"
	endclass "Person"

Like defining a struct, *class* keyword is used to start the definition of the class, it receive a string word as the class's name, and the *endclass* keyword is used to end the definition of the class, also it need the same name as the parameter, *class*, *endclass* and all keywords in the loop are fake keywords, they are only functions with some lua environment tricks, so we can't use the *end* to do the job for the best.

Now, we can create an object of the class :

	obj = Person()

Since the *Person* class is a empty class, the *obj* just works like a normal table.


Method
----

Calling an object's method is like sending a message to the object, so the object can do some operations. Take the *Person* class as an example, re-define it :

	class "Person"

		function GetName(self)
			return self.__Name
		end

		function SetName(self, name)
			self.__Name = tostring(name)
		end

	endclass "Person"

Any global functions that defined in the class definition with name not start with "_" are the methods of the class's objects. The object methods should have *self* as the first paramter to receive the object.

Here two methods are defined for the *Person*'s objects. *GetName* used to get the person's name, and *SetName* used to set the person's name. The objects are lua tables with special metatable settings, so the name value are stored in the person object itself in the field *__Name*, also you can use a special table to store the name value like :

	class "Person"

		_PersonName = setmetatable( {}, { __mode = "k" } )

		function GetName(self)
			return _PersonName[self]
		end

		function SetName(self, name)
			_PersonName[self] = tostring(name)
		end

	endclass "Person"

So, we can used it like :

	obj = Person()

	-- Thanks to lua's nature
	obj:SetName( "Kurapica" )

	-- Output : Hi Kurapica
	print( "Hi " .. obj:GetName() )

	-- Same like obj:GetName()
	-- The class can access any object methods as its field
	print( "Hi " .. Person.GetName(obj) )


Constructor
----

Well, it's better to give the name to a person object when objects are created. When define a global function with the class name, the function will be treated as the constructor function, like the object methods, it use *self* as the first paramter to receive the objecet, and all other paramters passed in.

	class "Person"

		-- Object Method
		function GetName(self)
			return self.__Name
		end

		function SetName(self, name)
			self.__Name = tostring(name)
		end

		-- Constructor
		function Person(self, name)
			self:SetName(name)
		end

	endclass "Person"

So, here we can use it like :

	obj = Person( "Kurapica" )

	-- Output : Hi Kurapica
	print( "Hi " .. obj:GetName() )


Class Method
----

Any global functions defined in the class's definition with name start with "_" are class methods, can't be used by the class's objects, as example, we can use a class method to count the persons :

	class "Person"

		_PersonCount = _PersonCount or 0

		-- Class Method
		function _GetPersonCount()
			return _PersonCount
		end

		-- Object Method
		function GetName(self)
			return self.__Name
		end

		function SetName(self, name)
			self.__Name = tostring(name)
		end

		-- Constructor
		function Person(self, name)
			_PersonCount = _PersonCount + 1

			self:SetName(name)
		end

	endclass "Person"

	obj = Person("A")
	obj = Person("B")
	obj = Person("C")

	-- Output : Person Count : 3
	print("Person Count : " .. Person._GetPersonCount())


Notice a global variable *_PersonCount* is used to count the persons, it can be decalred as local, but keep global is simple, and when re-define the class, the class won't lose informations about the old version objects(run the code again, you should get 6).


Property & Init with table
----

Properties are used to access the object's state, like *name*, *age* for a person. Normally, we can do this just using the lua table's field, but that lack the value validation and we won't know how and when the states are changed. So, the property system bring in like the other oop system.

So, here is the full definition format for a property :

	property "name" {
		Storage = "field",
		Get = "GetMethod" or function(self) end,
		Set = "SetMethod" or function(self, value) end,
		Type = types,
	}

* Storage - optional, the lowest priority, the real field in the object that store the data, can be used to read or write the property.

* Get - optional, the highest priority, if the value is string, the object method with the name same to the value will be used, if the value is a function, the function will be used as the read accessor, can be used to read the property.

* Set - optional, the highest priority, if the value is string, the object method with the name same to the value will be used, if the value is a function, the function will be used as the write accessor, can be used to write the property.

* Type - optional, just like define member types in the struct, if set, when write the property, the value would be validated by the type settings.

So, re-define the *Person* class with the property :

	class "Person"

		property "Name" {
			Storage = "__Name",
			Type = System.String,
		}

	endclass "Person"

With the property system, we can create objects with a new format, called *Init with a table* :

	obj = Person { Name = "A", Age = 20 }

	-- Output : A	A	20
	print( obj.Name, obj.__Name, obj.Age )

If only a normal table passed to the class to create the object, the object will be created with no parameters, and then any key-value paris in the table will be tried to write to the object (just like obj[key] = value). If you want some parameters be passed into the class's constructor, the features will be added in the *Attribute* system.

With the *Storage*, the reading and writing are the quickest, but normally, we need to do more things when the object's properties are accessed, like return a default value when data not existed. So, here is a full example to show *Get* and *Set* :

	class "Person"

		-- Object method
		function GetName(self)
			return self.__Name or "Anonymous"
		end

		-- Property
		property "Name" {
			-- Using the object method
			Get = "GetName",

			-- Using special set function
			Set = function(self, name)
				local oldname = self.Name

				self.__Name = name

				print("The name is changed from " .. oldname .. " to " .. self.Name)
			end,

			-- So in set method, no need to valdiate the 'name' value
			Type = System.String + nil,
		}

	endclass "Person"

So, the *Get* part is using the object method *GetName*, and the *Set* part is using an anonymous function to do the job.

	obj = Person()

	-- Output : The name is changed from Anonymous to A
	obj.Name = "A"


Event
----

The events are used to let the outside know changes happened in the objects. The outside can access the object's properties to know what's the state of the object, and call the method to manipulate the objects, but when some state changes, like click on a button, the outside may want know when and how those changes happened, and the event system is used to provide such features, it's used by the objects to send out messages to the outside.

	event "name"

The *event* keyword is used to declare an event with the event name. So, here we declare an event *OnNameChanged* fired when the *Person*'s *Name* property is changed.

	class "Person"

		-- Event
		event "OnNameChanged"

		-- Property
		property "Name" {
			Get = function(self)
				return self.__Name or "Anonymous"
			end,

			Set = function(self, name)
				local oldName = self.Name

				self.__Name = name

				-- Fire the event with parameters
				self:OnNameChanged(oldName, self.Name)
			end,

			Type = System.String + nil,
		}
	endclass "Person"

It looks like we just give the object a *OnNameChanged* method, and call it when needed. The truth is the *self.OnNameChanged* is an object created from *System.EventHandler* class. It's used to control all event handlers (functions), there are two type event handlers :

* Stackable event handler

* Normal event handler

So, it's quick to use an example to show the different :

	obj = Person()

	-- Stackable event handler
	obj.OnNameChanged = obj.OnNameChanged + function(self, old, new)
		print("Stack 1 : ", old, new)
	end

	-- Normal event handler
	function obj:OnNameChanged(old, new)
		print("Normal 1 : ", old, new)
	end

	-- Another global stackable event handler
	function OnNameChangedHandler(self, old, new)
		print("Stack 2 : ", old, new)
	end

	obj.OnNameChanged = obj.OnNameChanged + OnNameChangedHandler

	-- Another normal event handler
	obj.OnNameChanged = function(self, old, new)
		print("Normal 2 : ", old, new)
	end

	-- The last stackable event handler
	obj.OnNameChanged = obj.OnNameChanged + function(self, old, new)
		print("Stack 3 : ", old, new)
	end

	obj.Name = "Kurapica"

	print("------------------")

	obj.OnNameChanged = obj.OnNameChanged - OnNameChangedHandler

	obj.Name = "Another"

	print("------------------")

	-- A handler return true
	obj.OnNameChanged = obj.OnNameChanged + function(self, old, new)
		print("Stack 4 : ", old, new)

		return true
	end

	obj.Name = "Last"

Here is the result :

	Stack 1 : 	Anonymous	Kurapica
	Stack 2 : 	Anonymous	Kurapica
	Stack 3 : 	Anonymous	Kurapica
	Normal 2 : 	Anonymous	Kurapica
	------------------
	Stack 1 : 	Kurapica	Another
	Stack 3 : 	Kurapica	Another
	Normal 2 : 	Kurapica	Another
	------------------
	Stack 1 : 	Another	Last
	Stack 3 : 	Another	Last
	Stack 4 : 	Another	Last


So, we can get detail from the example :

* There can be many stackable event handlers, handlers can be added or removed by + / -.

* There can be only one normal event handler, older one will be replaced by the new one.

* When an event is fired, the stackable event handlers are called at the first time, first registered first be called, the normal event handler will be the last.

* Any handler return true will stop the calling operation, any handlers after it won't be called.


It's not good to use the *EventHandler* directly, anytime access the object's *EventHandler*, the object will create the *EventHandler* when not existed. So, fire an event without any handlers will be a greate waste of memeory. There are two ways to do it :

* Using *System.Reflector.FireObjectEvent*, for the previous example :

		self:OnNameChanged(oldName, self.Name)

		-- Change to

		System.Reflector.FireObjectEvent(self, "OnNameChanged", oldName, self.Name)

* Inherit from *System.Object*, then using the *Fire* method :

		class "Person"
			inherit "System.Object"  -- Explained later

			-- Declare the event
			event "OnNameChanged"

			property "Name" {
				Get = function(self)
					return self.__Name or "Anonymous"
				end,

				Set = function(self, name)
					local oldName = self.Name

					self.__Name = name

					-- Fire the event with parameters
					self:Fire("OnNameChanged", oldName, self.Name)
				end,
				Type = System.String + nil,
			}

		endclass "Person"

The inheritance Systems is a powerful feature in the object-oriented program, it makes the class can using the features in its super class.

Here, the *System.Object* class is a class that should be other classes's super class, contains many useful method, the *Fire* method is used to fire an event, it won't create the *EventHandler* object when not needed.


Meta-method
----

In lua, a table can have many metatable settings, like *__call* use the table as a function, more details can be found in [Lua 5.1 Reference Manual](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html#2.8).

Since the objects are lua tables with special metatable set by the Loop system, setmetatable can't be used to the objects. But it's easy to provide meta-method for the objects, take the *__call* as an example :

	class "Person"

		-- Property
		property "Name" {
			Storage = "__Name",
			Type = System.String + nil,
		}

		-- Meta-method
		function __call(self, name)
			print("Hello, " .. name .. ", it's " .. self.Name)
		end

	endclass "Person"

So, just declare a global function with the meta-method's name, and it can be used like :

	obj = Person { Name = "Dean" }

	-- Output : Hello, Sam, it's Dean
	obj("Sam")

All metamethod can used include the *__index* and *__newindex*. Also a new metamethod used by the Loop system : *__exist*, the *__exist* method receive all parameters passed to the constructor, and decide if there is an existed object, if true, return the object directly.

	class "Person"

		_PersonStorage = setmetatable( {}, { __mode = "v" })

		-- Constructor
		function Person(self, name)
			_PersonStorage[name] = self
		end

		-- __exist
		function __exist(name)
			return _PersonStorage[name]
		end

	endclass "Person"

So, here is a test :

	print(Person("A"))

Run the test anytimes, the result will be the same.


Inheritance
----

The inheritance system is the most important system in an oop system. In the Loop, it make the classes can gain the object methods, properties, events, metamethods settings from its superclass.

The format is

	inherit ( superclass )

	or

	inherit "superclass path"

The *inherit* keyword can only be used in the class definition. In the previous example, the *Person* class inherit from *System.Object* class, so it can use the *Fire* method defined in it. One class can only have one super class.

* In many scene, the class should override its superclass's method, and also want to use the origin method in it. The key features is, in the class definition, a var named *Super* can be used as the superclass, so here is an example :

		class "A"

			function Print(self)
				print("Here is A's Print.")
			end

		endclass "A"

		class "B"
			inherit "A"

			function Print(self)
				Super.Print( self )

				print("Here is B's Print.")
			end

		endclass "B"

		-- Test part
		obj = B()

		obj:Print()

	So, we got

		Here is A's Print.
		Here is B's Print.

	It's all right if you want keep the origin method as a local var like, it's the quickest way to call functions :

		class "B"
			inherit "A"

			local oldPrint = Super.Print

			function Print(self)
				oldPrint( self )

				print("Here is B's Print.")
			end

		endclass "B"

	But when re-define the *A* class, the *oldPrint* would point to an old version *Print* method, it's better to avoid, unless you don't need to re-define any features.

* With the inheritance system, go back to the property definition :

		property "name" {
			Storage = "field",
			Get = "GetMethod" or function(self) end,
			Set = "SetMethod" or function(self, value) end,
			Type = types,
		}

	Normally, if want the property accessors can be changed in the child-classes, it's better to define the get & set object methods, and using the name of the methods as the *Get* & *Set* part's value in the property definition, so the child-class only need to override the object methods to change the behavior of the property accesses. Like the *Person* class :

		class "Person"

			-- Object method
			function GetName(self)
				return self.__Name
			end

			function SetName(self, name)
				self.__Name = name
			end

			-- Property
			property "Name" {
				Get = "GetName",
				Set = "SetName",
				Type = System.String + nil,
			}

			-- Meta-method
			function __call(self, name)
				print("Hello, " .. name .. ", it's " .. self.Name)
			end

		endclass "Person"

	So, when a child-class of the *Person* re-define the *GetName* or *SetName*, there is no need to override the property *Name*.

	If override the property definition in the child-class, the superclass's property will be removed from the child-class.

* Like the object methods, override the metamethods is the same, take *__call* as example, *super.__call* can be used to retrieve the superclass's *__call* metamethod.

* When the class create an object, the object should passed to its super class's constructor first, and then send to the class's constructor, unlike oop system in the other languages, the child-class can't acess any vars defined in super-class's definition environment, it's simple that the child-class focus on how to manipulate the object that created from the super-class.

		class "A"
			function A(self)
				print ("[A]" .. tostring(self))
			end
		endclass "A"

		class "B"
			inherit "A"

			function B(self)
				print("[B]" .. tostring(self))
			end
		endclass "B"

		obj = B()

	Ouput :

		[A]table: 0x7fe080ca4680
		[B]table: 0x7fe080ca4680

* Focus on the event handlers, so why need two types, take an example first :

		class "Person"
			inherit "System.Object"

			event "OnNameChanged"

			property "Name" {
				Storage = "__Name",
				Set = function(self, name)
					local oldName = self.__Name

					self.__Name = name

					return self:Fire("OnNameChanged", oldName, name)
				end,
				Type = System.String,
			}

			property "GUID" {
				Storage = "__ID",
				Type = System.String,
			}

			function Person(self)
				math.randomseed(os.time())

				local guid = ""

				for i = 1, 8 do
					guid = guid .. ("%04X"):format(math.random(0xffff))

					if i > 1 and i < 6 then
						guid = guid .. "-"
					end
				end

				self.GUID = guid
			end
		endclass "Person"

	Here is a *Person* class definition, it has two properties, one *Name* used to storage a person's name, a *GUID* used to mark the unique person, so we can diff two person with the same name. When a new person add to the system, we create the object with a new guid like :

		person = Person { Name = "Jane" }

	And a new guid is created for the person like 'C2022B9F-ADC2-BBA6-B911-2F670757AD12', then we can save the person's data to somewhere, and when we need we could read the data, and create the person again like :

		person = Person { Name = "Jane", GUID = "C2022B9F-ADC2-BBA6-B911-2F670757AD12" }

	The *Person* class is a simple class used as the root class, we can create many child-class like *Child* and *Adult*, so *Child* should have a *Guardian* property point to another person object, and so on. So, there is an event *OnNameChanged* that fired when the person's name is changed. Now we define a *Member* class inherited from the *Person*, also it will count person based on the name.

		class "Member"
			inherit "Person"

			_NameCount = {}

			-- Class Method
			function _GetMemberCount(name)
				return _NameCount[name] or 0
			end

			-- Event handler
			local function OnNameChanged(self, old, new)
				if old then
					_NameCount[old] = _NameCount[old] - 1
				end

				if new then
					_NameCount[new] = (_NameCount[new] or 0) + 1
				end
			end

			-- Constructor
			function Member(self)
				self.OnNameChanged = self.OnNameChanged + OnNameChanged
			end
		endclass "Member"

	So, in the *Member* class, a stackable handler is added for the object, normally, the stackable handler is used in the child-class's definition, so the child-class won't remove any handler added by its super classes.

	And for the final using, normal handler is easy to write, and the user won't need to know anything about the stackable handlers.

		a = Member { Name = "Jane" }

		function a:OnNameChanged(old, new)
			print(old .. " rename to " .. new)
		end

		-- Output : Jane rename to Ann
		a.Name = "Ann"

		b = Member { Name = "Ann" }
		c = Member { Name = "King" }

		-- Output : Member count for 'Ann' : 2
		print("Member count for 'Ann' : " .. Member._GetMemberCount( "Ann" ))



partclass & re-define
----

* The class can be re-defined, and the object that created from the old version class, will use the new version's features.

		class "A"
		endclass "A"

		obj = A()

		-- Re-define the class A
		class "A"
			function Hi(self)
				print( "Hello" )
			end
		endclass "A"

		-- Outout : Hello
		obj:Hi()

* When re-define a class, its object methods, class methods, events, properties and meta-methods all will be cleared. So :

		class "A"
			function Hi(self)
				print( "Hello" )
			end
		endclass "A"

		obj = A()

		class "A"
		endclass "A"

		-- Error : attempt to call method 'Hi' (a nil value)
		obj:Hi()

* Any global vars with no function values should be kept in the class definition's environment, so we can used it again :

		class "A"
			_Objs = _Objs or {}

			function A(self, name)
				_Objs[name] = self
			end

			function __exist(name)
				return _Objs[name]
			end
		endclass "A"

		print( A("HI") )

		-- Re-define agian
		class "A"
			_Objs = _Objs or {}

			function A(self, name)
				_Objs[name] = self
			end

			function __exist(name)
				return _Objs[name]
			end
		endclass "A"

		print( A("HI") )

	Output :

		table: 0x7fe080c4a410
		table: 0x7fe080c4a410

* partclass is used to start the class definition without clearance :

		class "A"
			function Hi(self)
				print( "Hello" )
			end
		endclass "A"

		obj = A()

		partclass "A"
		endclass "A"

		-- Output : Hello
		obj:Hi()

* When re-define the class, any sub-class will receive the new features that inherited from the super class, won't receive if they have their owns.

		class "A"
		endclass "A"

		class "B"
			inherit "A"
		endclass "B"

		obj = B()

		class "A"
			function Hi(self)
				print( "Hello" )
			end
		endclass "A"

		-- Output : Hello
		obj:Hi()


interface
====

Using the interface is like the class, the format is

	extend ( interface ) ( interface2 ) ( interface3 ) ...

	or

	extend "interface path" "interface2 path" "interface3 path" ...

The definition of an interface is started with *interface* and end with *endinterface* :

	-- Define an interface has one method
	interface "IFGreet"
		function Greet(self)
			print("Hi, I'm " .. self.Name)
		end
	endinterface "IFGreet"

	-- Define an interface with one property
	interface "IFName"
		property "Name" {
			Storage = "__Name",
			Type = System.String,
		}
	endinterface "IFName"

	-- Define a class extend from the interfaces
	class "Person"
		-- so the Person class have one method and one property from the two interfaces
		extend "IFName" "IFGreet"
	endclass "Person"

	obj = Person { Name = "Ann" }

	-- Output : Hi, I'm Ann
	obj:Greet()

In the Loop system, the interface system is used to support multi-inheritance. One class can only inherited from one super class, but can extend from no-limit interfaces, also an interface can extend from other interfaces.

Define an interface is just like define a class with little different :

* The interface can't be used to create objects.

* Define events, properties, object methods is the same like the define them in the classes.

* Global method start with "_" are interface methods, can only be called by the interface itself.

* Global method whose name is the interface name, is initializer , will receive object that created from the classes that extend from the interface without any other paramters.

* No meta-methods can be defined in the interface.

* Re-define interface is like re-define a class, any features would be passed to classes that extend from it.

* like the *partclass*, *partinterface* is used to re-define the interface without clearance.


Init & Dispose
----

In class, there may be a constructor, in interface, there may be a initializer, they are used to do the init jobs to the object, and when we don't need the object anymore, we need to clear the object, so it can be collected by the lua's garbage collector.

Normally, if in the definition, we use some table to cache the object's data, when clear the object, we should clear the cache tables, so no reference will keep the object away from garbage collector.

There are a special method used by all objects named *Dispose*, and any class, interface can define a *Dispose* method to clear reference for themselves.

Take one class as the first example :

	class "A"
		-- Used to store real name values
		_Name = {}

		-- Dispose
		function Dispose(self)
			-- remove the reference from _Name
			_Name[self] = nil
		end

		property "Name" {
			Get = function(self) return _Name[self] or "Anonymous" end,
			Set = function(self, name) _Name[self] = name end,
			Type = System.String + nil,
		}
	endclass "A"

	obj = A { Name = "Jane" }

	-- Dispose the object
	obj:Dispose()
	obj = nil

If your class or interface won't add any reference to the object, there is no need to decalre a *Dispose* method. And remember, the obj.Dispose is not A.Dispose, all objects use a same method, and the method would call the *Dispose* method that defined in the classes and interfaces.

So, that leave one problem, what's the order of the init and dispose in the inheritance system. Just an example will show :

	interface "IFA"
	    function Dispose(self)
	        print("IFA <-", self.Name)
	    end

	    function IFA(self)
	        print("IFA ->", self.Name)
	    end
	endinterface "IFA"

	interface "IFB"
	    function Dispose(self)
	        print("IFB <-", self.Name)
	    end

	    function IFB(self)
	        print("IFB ->", self.Name)
	    end
	endinterface "IFB"

	interface "IFC"
	    extend "IFB"

	    function Dispose(self)
	        print("IFC <-", self.Name)
	    end

	    function IFC(self)
	        print("IFC ->", self.Name)
	    end
	endinterface "IFC"

	class "A"
	    extend "IFA"

	    function Dispose(self)
	        print("A <-", self.Name)
	    end
	    function A(self, name)
	        self.Name = name
	        print("A ->", name)
	    end
	endclass "A"

	class "B"
	    inherit "A"
	    extend "IFC"

	    function Dispose(self)
	        print("B <-", self.Name)
	    end

	    function B(self, name)
	        print("B ->", name)
	    end
	endclass "B"

	obj = B("Test")
	print("-----------------------")
	obj:Dispose()

The result :

	A ->	Test
	B ->	Test
	IFA ->	Test
	IFB ->	Test
	IFC ->	Test
	-----------------------
	IFC <-	Test
	IFB <-	Test
	IFA <-	Test
	B <-	Test
	A <-	Test

So, the rule is :

* For the init :

	* The class's constructor would be called before call the interfaces's initializer.

	* All parameter should be passed into the class and all its superclasses's constructor, and the superclass's constructor will be called first.

	* No other parameter would be passed into the interfaces' initializer, the superclass's interface's initializer would be called first, and if the class has more than one interfaces, first extended will be called first.

* For the dispose : just reversed order of the init.


How to use
----

The oop system is used to describe any real world object into data, using the property to represent the object's state like person's name, birthday, sex, and etc, using the methods to represent what the object can do, like walking, talking and more.

The class is used to descrbie a group of objects with same behaviors. Like *Person* for human beings.

The interface don't represent a group of objects, it don't know what objects will use the features of it, but it know what can be used by the objects.

Take the game as an example, to display the health points of the player, we may display it in text, or something like the health orb in the Diablo, and if using text, we may display it in percent, or some short format like '101.3 k'. So, the text or texture is the objects that used to display the data, and we can use an interface to provide the data like :

	interface "IFHealth"

		_IFHealthObjs = {}

		-- Object method
		function SetValue(self, value)
		end

		-- Interface method
		function _SetValue(value)
			-- Refresh all objects's value
			for _, obj in ipairs(_IFHealthObjs) do
				obj:SetValue(value)
			end
		end

		-- Dispose
		function Dispose(self)
			-- Remove the object
			for i, obj in ipairs(_IFHealthObjs) do
				if obj == self then
					return table.remove(_IFHealthObjs, i)
				end
			end
		end

		-- Initializer
		function IFHealth(self)
			-- Register the object
			table.insert(_IFHealthObjs, self)
		end

	endinterface "IFHealth"

In the interface, a empty method *SetValue* is defined, it will be override by the classes that extended from the *IFHealth*, so in the *_SetValue* interface method, there is no need to check whether the object has a *SetValue* method.

And for a text to display the health point, if we have a *Label* class used to display strings with a *SetText* method to display, we can create a new class to do the job like :

	class "HealthText"
		inherit "Label"
		extend "IFHealth"

		-- Override the method
		function SetValue(self, value)
			self:SetText( ("%d"):format(value) )
		end
	endclass "HealthText"

So, when a *HealthText*'s object is created, it will be stored into the *_IFHealthObjs* table, and when the system call

	IFHealth._SetValue(10000)

The text of the object would be refreshed to the new value.
